## Features

- [x] Sort and section a list of items
- [x] Listen for live updates
- [x] Animate underlying data changes
- [x] Fetch associated values in batch
- [x] Support paginated requests
- [x] Comprehensive Unit Test Coverage

## Usage

FetchRequests can be used for any combination of networking, database, and file queries.
It is best when backed by something like a [WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) where you're expecting your data to live update.

To get started, you create a `CWFetchRequest` which explains your data access patterns.
The `CWFetchedResultsController` is the interface to access the your data.
It will automatically cache your associated values for the lifetime of that controller.
If a memory pressure event occurs, it will release its hold on those objects, allowing them to be deinited.

The example app has an UserDefaults-backed storage mechanism.
The unit tests have in-memory objects, with NotificationCenter eventing.

Today, it is heavily dependent on the Obj-C runtime, as well as Key-Value Observation.
With Swift 5.1 it should be possible to further remove those restrictions.

It currently relies upon a bundled `JSON` raw data representation.
Everything is in place to remove this restriction, but the swift compiler crashes if so.
